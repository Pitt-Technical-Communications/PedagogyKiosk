GitHub:
-We used GitHub to host this project, so that we could all work on it simultaneously. Essentially, we all cloned the repository onto our respective computers which creates a working copy. Then we used GitHub desktop, which is an application, to push and pull our changes to the master repository. GitHub also has a project feature, where you can add and move tasks along a pipeline.
